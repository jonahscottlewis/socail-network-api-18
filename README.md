## User Story

AS A USER 
I WANT TO have access to test API routes 
SO THAT I can use them for a social media application

## Description

This is a set of API for a social network that uses a MongoDB database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data, Express.js for routing, Mongoose ODM, and the moment package to format time stamps.
